# UF Microcomputer Museum

## Description
The goal of this project is to replicate the functionality of Nintendo's Famicom/NES system on an FPGA using solely open source tools and methods. Our secondary goal is to then create a system that educates the user on how computers or more specifically the Famicom/NES system works. This repository holds all the requisite code in order for our hardware to run, may make a seperate repository if we decide to create seperate software (possibly an IDE to make NES ROMs) to accompany our hardware.

## Features

* N/A

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/UF-Microcomputer-Museum/Hardware
cd Hardware
```

## Hardware Requirements 
At this stage of the project we will be making use of the **DE-10 Lite** until we find a better alternative.

## Sofware Requirements
As of now we will be testing our HDL code on a **DE-10 Lite** which requires **Quartus** in order to load our HDL code.
