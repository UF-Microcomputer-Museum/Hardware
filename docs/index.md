# What is the Microcomputer Museum?

The microcomputer museum will pair original, physical hardware with interactive displays running best-in-class recreations running on FPGAs (and occasionally emulators) with the goal of mimicing original hardware as accurately as possible.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to replicate the functionality of Nintendo's Famicom/NES system on an FPGA using solely open source tools and methods. Our secondary goal is to then create a system that educates the user on how computers or more specifically the Famicom/NES system works.
